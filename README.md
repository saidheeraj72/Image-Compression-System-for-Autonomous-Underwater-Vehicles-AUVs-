# Autoencoder Image Compression Project

## Overview
This project explores image compression using autoencoders, achieving high-quality compression while preserving visual fidelity.

## Project Description
The project aims to develop an efficient image compression technique leveraging autoencoders. By training a deep neural network, we aim to encode high-dimensional image data into compact representations, enabling efficient storage and transmission of multimedia content.

## Features
- Utilizes deep learning and autoencoder architecture
- Achieves high-quality compression with minimal information loss
- Potential for real-world application in multimedia storage and transmission
